# A peculiarity of dependency caching in Gradle means that to avoid uploading the cache after every build you need to
# add the following lines to your .travis.yml:
before_cache:
  - rm -f  $HOME/.gradle/caches/modules-2/modules-2.lock
  - rm -fr $HOME/.gradle/caches/*/plugin-resolution/
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.gradle/caches/
    - $HOME/.gradle/wrapper/

# Main run
install:
  - ./gradlew :lib:assemble
  - ./gradlew :server:assemble
  - ./gradlew :client:assemble
script:
  - ./gradlew :lib:check
  - ./gradlew :server:check
  - ./gradlew :client:check
